<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2scss-map)

There are many lots of Json-sass package available on npm; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs. So, I thought of creating one.
Altough, i find one that's good enough & made by [Andrew Clark](https://github.com/acdlite). But that wasn't maintained from last 6+ years.

This is an Utility module that converts a JSON stream into sass maps. It can be used as whitelabeling themes, fonts etc.

Here's why it's best:
* firstly, you can share values between your scripts and stylesheets without having to use something like [SassyJSON](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyJSON), which doesn't work with libsass.
* json2scss-map converts JSON objects into Sass maps, which are supported in Ruby Sass 3.3 and libsass 2.0. & latest Dart Sass.
* Also, New Version includes color convertions to `HEX, HSL, RGB` ðŸ˜Ž

### Built With

This is a very small package without any major dependency. However, we use some packages for giving support for browser-compatible Javascript, Unit testing etc.

* [Babel](https://babel.dev)
* [Chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai)
* [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha)
* [Through2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/through2)

# json2scss-map

Utility module that converts a JSON stream into scss syntax sass-map

json2scss-map converts JSON objects into Sass maps, which are supported in Ruby Sass 3.3 and libsass 2.0.

```
npm i --save-dev json2scss-map
```

## Why?

Firstly, you can share values between your scripts and stylesheets without having to use something like [SassyJSON](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SassyJSON), which doesn't work with libsass.
This package it's not build from Scratch, we have fork the project from [Andrew Clark](https://github.com/acdlite) .
But jsonSass package isn't maintained from last 5+ years. As we use this package with all the vernabilities , we thought we would fix the issues and make it better.

## Examples

Example source file `theme.json`:
```
{
  "font-primary": "Roboto",
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#0007bff",
    "success": "#388E3C",
    "error": "#EF5350",
    "text-black": "#333333",
    "black-overlay": "rgba(0, 0, 0, .2)"
  },
  "fonts": {
    "txt-12": "11px",
    "txt-75": "75ch"
  },
  "w-80": "80vw"
}

```

Output `theme.scss`:

```scss
$variable:(
  "font-primary": "Roboto",
  "colors": (
    "primary": #007bff,
    "success": #388E3C,
    "error": #EF5350,
    "text-black": #333333,
    "black-overlay": rgba(0, 0, 0, .2)
  ),
  "fonts": (
    "txt-12": 11px,
    "txt-75": 75ch
  ),
  "w-80": 80vw
);
```

you can use the Node fs Module (recommended):

``` javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var json2scss = require('json2scss-map');

fs.createReadStream('theme.json')
  .pipe(json2scss({
    prefix: '$variable: ',
  }))
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('theme.scss'));
```

Then, you can get the values from scss:map 

```scss
  $color-primary: map-get(map-get($variable, "colors"), "primary"); // #007bff
  $font-family: map-get($variable, "font-primary"); // "Roboto"
```

You can also transform normal JavaScript values using the exposed utility function:

```javascript
json2scss.convertJs([1, 2, 3]); // (1, 2, 3)
```


## ISSUE

Please let us know the issues on issues tab. We will happy to fix the update the package .
